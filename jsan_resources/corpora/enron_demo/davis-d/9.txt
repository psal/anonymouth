Father, bless everyone on this list in a special way, open supernatural doors in their life today, give them a double portion of your Spirit as we take back everything that the devil has stolen from us: Health, Finance,Children, Jobs, Homes, Marriages.  Amen. Let's take time to pray. Take  60 seconds & give this a shot! Let's just see satan stop this one. All you do is: 1)    simply say a small prayer for the person who sent you this, 2)    then send it on to five other people. . . within hours five people have prayed for you, and you caused a multitude of people to pray to God for other people. . . then sit back and watch the power of God work in your life for doing the thing that you know He loves.
