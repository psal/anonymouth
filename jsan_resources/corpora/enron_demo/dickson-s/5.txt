the natural gas Spot GTC - on with and one without credit.  Also attached is a new version of the Firm GTC without credit.  There was a typo in the one I sent yesterday.  The Firm GTC with credit that I sent yesterday does not have the typo. Stacy I just caught a typo in the Spot version with credit.  Attached is a corrected version. Randy, Attached is a clean version and a redlined version of the above-referenced document which incorporates the changes that we discussed with the exception of the end of Section 4.2, Section 4.5 and Section 4.6.  That language was added based on what our credit department wants.  Please review and call me with any comments (713) 853-5705. Thanks, Stacy Nothing would make me happier than reviewing this guaranty for you! 	Russell Diamond/ENRON@enronXgate Gregg, I have a conference call from 2-4 tomorrow and I have a lunch meeting.  Other than that I am open. Stacy Let's try this again! My 2-4 conference call tomorrow just got canceled. Thank you. Attached is a redlined version of the Spot GTC (without credit) that shows the changes that were made.  The same changes were made to all of the other GTCs.  Hope this helps. Stacy http://www. pbs. org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/blackout/ I found the correct version.  Here it is. Stacy New version with straight quotes and other changes.
