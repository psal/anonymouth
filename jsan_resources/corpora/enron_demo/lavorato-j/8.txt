Unify system is on the brink of disaster and everyone agrees that we have huge business risk if it blows up. -->  Sally and Beth are going to document the steps we are taking to maintain the system and minimize the chances of a failure.  (everyone understands that this is a difficult task but it sounds like it should be a high priority) 2.  The database to run the gas books takes way too long and is leading to long hours on the part of our back office staff.  -->  Beth is moving from Sun-O-S to Sun-Sularis which should allow us to address the problem.  We have 4 contractors working on this and we are expecting it to take 6 weeks.  Once this project is complete we can add hardware and reduce the time problems. 3.   The traders need better real time management tools that ultimately combine their physical and financial trades together and identify their real time risk. TDS was a system that was built to help this however it does not meet all the traders needs.  This ultimately needs to be a system that is commissioned by the               traders to meet their needs. -->  Phillip Allen is going to prepare a list of trader needs in consultation with all the gas desks heads.   After this Beth should try to come up with a plan to get a system that meets all the traders needs. 4.  The power system is unstable and fails on a regular basis.  This is leading to long hours on the part of our back office staff.  Beth has made progress in this area and we are going to monitor the improvements over the next 4 to 6 weeks to see if the improvements prove to be working. 5.  Steve Natt  is going to put a plan together that meets with Kevin Presto's approval that addresses our needs with respect to all-requirements deals and volume management deals in the east. 6.  There will be no more business trips to London (somewhat kidding). 7.  Portland has issues with speed do to the fact that we still run their books through an interface with Houston.  -->  John Lavorato will talk to Tim Beldon and Beth to determine whether its worthwile to put servers in Portland.    -->  Since Tim was not in the meeting, John will make sure we are covering all his needs. Where did you ever get the idea for this? Jeff Please confirm that the assistants are going to the Houstonian to learn how to read the screens. Dave Give me a call on the weekend if you get a chance.  I talked to Shankman and he talks about more groups going to Global than I thought.  Like to discuss.
