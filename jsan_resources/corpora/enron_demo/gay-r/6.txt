We don't have any idea at this point in time which course of action is likely to be successful - so we can not base our next step with Furnas (assuming tuesday's meeting with Furnas is unproductive) on which of those paths we take.   I was hopeful we could pursue an arbitration course or some other course with Furnas, to increase the pressue - possible get a favorable outcome, and provide political ramifications - and retain our other course of actions by being able to stop the arbitration when it is opportune time to begin our final push (after gas arrives). We need to be close to final decision on what we do next with Furnas on wednesday.  John and Rob - please make sure we know if and what we can arbitrate on Wednesday, and lets also make sure we have assessed  all other possible/feasible next steps with Furnas ahead of Wednesday.

Our goal is to get as much of Enron's money out as soon as we can.  How we do that is the difficult part and complex decision tree.

Thanks Pete I like this conceptually as an approach to manage costs but see the potential problems with Shell if EECC is paid on time.
