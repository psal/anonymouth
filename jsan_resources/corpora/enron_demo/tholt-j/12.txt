a summary of the discussions last week regarding the complaint against El Paso for oversubscribing the Socal Topock Point. The meeting started out by summarizing the dollar impact of the Border cuts to Amoco and Burlington of $3 million dollars and the additional fuel costs  of $15 million that they have incurred when the mainline fuel was reduced and the gathering fuel was increased.  Accordingly, producers are seeking a minimum of $17  million in compensation in some form or  another. The biggest concern is that a total of 1.2 bcf/day is being nominated at the Socal Topock which can only deliver 540000 mmbtu/day.   Socal Gas stated that this problem should go away when there system becomes unbundled (referred to as Gatekeeper). .  The proceeding is currently pending CPUC approval and could be implemented as early as October 1, 2001.  When the Gatekeeper is implemented  , only 540000 mmbtu/day will be accepted at the Socal Topock border and must match up with the intra-state transport.  SoCal Gas suggested taking the 1.2 bcf/day of nominations at the Topock delivery point and divide it up based on the original intent of the capapcity-  400 to Mohave; 540 to Socal Topock;  and 180 to PGE Topock.  They also stated they would accept less than 540 at Topock but  needed a minimum of 300 to meet core needs.  However, they wanted some type of compensation if their volume was reduced.   They also agreed to live with the status quo until the Gatekeeper was implemented.  This would result in firm rights being established at Socal Topock based on downstream rights. Williams owns Block 3 capacity and is willing to look at a CD reduction or a reduced take requirement or use of alternate points with a rate adjustment. After much discussion,  El Paso came back with the following counter proposal: Recommended interim solution until Socal Gatekeeper implemented.  Does not relate to receipt point rights. 1)  Block 1 Capacity will always be alternate to Socal Topock (198000); 2)Block II Capacity can not be sold at PGE Topock (614000) 3) Amoco and OneOk each have a contract 45000/d which can go to Topock or Ehrenberg.  It is recommended that they give up their Ehrenberg right and keep Topock right and Socal will give up like amount at Topock as well as shift an additional  70000 mmbtu/day from Topock to Ehrenberg resulting in approx. 115000 being shifted  to Ehrenberg. 4) Rights fro expansion shippers would be carved up as follows: Socal Topock   PGE/Mohave Topock Texaco   40    135 Burlington  26    74 Aero   5    15 Borax   7    12 LADWP  0    36 SWGas   0    20 5) Socal Topock would now be divided as follows: Expansion Shippers  78000 Socal Gas           425000 BLK 3                               348000 (25-Amoco;20-Oneok;99-Williams;189 El Paso Merchant;15-Wlliams) Total 851000 540 divided by 841 would result in 37 percent cuts
