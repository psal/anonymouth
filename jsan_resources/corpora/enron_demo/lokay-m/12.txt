Houston  CORRECTION In the document I sent out this morning, "Instructions to install Internet explorer 5" The Instructions said to type: "U:\COMMOM\ie5\i386\setup. exe" in the run dialog box. It should have read "N:\common\ie5\i386\setup. exe" .  I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. If you have any problems with or questions about the install please call the help desk at 78-7454 Thank you Dan Bunch 11/27/2000 10:20 AM To: Michael Bodnar/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Sean Bolks/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Theresa Branney/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Craig Buehler/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Bob Burleson/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Reyna Cabrera/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Lee Ferrell/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Morgan Gottsponer/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Stephen Herber/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Martha Janousek/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Dana Jones/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Bill Mangels/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Robert Mason/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Penny McCarran/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Vernon Mercaldo/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Sue Neville/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Don Powell/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Pilar Ramirez/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Michael G Stage/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Rockey Storie/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Kay Threet/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Mike Ullom/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Kimberly Watson/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Linda Wehring/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Steve Weller/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Jim Wiltfong/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Lindy Donoho/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Jeffery Fawcett/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Steven Harris/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Kevin Hyatt/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Lorraine Lindberg/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, TK Lohman/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Michelle Lokay/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Audrey Robertson/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Christine Stokes/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc: Jean McFarland/Corp/Enron, Bob Martinez/ET&S/Enron@ENRON Subject: Dashboard and Internet Explorer 5.01 upgrade.
