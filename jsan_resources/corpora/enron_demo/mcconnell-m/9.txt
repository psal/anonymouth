Strategy ? Target Market Criteria ? Enron Today/Enron Tomorrow Here are a couple of other thoughts and ideas. We need to emphasize our new businesses outside the energy business=20 (obvious).  Clickpaper. com will be out and live just before the analyst=20 meetings.  This is very exciting and could take the industry by storm=20 (eventually).  Especially with Jeff=01,s comments with the analysts.  This= =20 should be emphasized with the metals piece.  The concept is that here are 2= =20 new areas where Enron is going to change the "old economy" businesses and= =20 industries.  Clickpaper will have real time pricing which is different than= =20 all the other 15 existing sites.  All of the others are charging 3% fees fo= r=20 matching buyers and sellers in a bulletin board or auction type of=20 transactions. We will also have that functionality (and will charge 1% or $= 0=20 (we=01,ll update you later) but will also have an EOL type of real time pri= cing=20 component (this piece will be free).  This piece will not be ready for July= =20 25th but will be announced publicly and in final development stages (should= =20 be out by end of 3rd qtr. ).  I believe that the link with Net Works with bo= th=20 paper and metals is very important for providing a more complete picture th= an=20 just metals alone.  Also for your information, we are working on 2=20 acquisition deals that will be coming out soon, 1 is to buy a mill and coul= d=20 be announced next week, which will also clarify and add to the story since = we=20 will have access to physical pulp and paper.  Paper must be an important=20 piece of the presentation.  Greg Piper is the MD for Clickpaper and he can= =20 answer any other questions and fill you in and answer more questions.  He c= an=20 be reached at ext. 36635. Also, on the "Target Markets" page, I would reorder;  put Lumber underneath= =20 pulp and paper and think about separating the others as potential markets. = =20 That way we could actually check off the top 3 as "done" and the others are= =20 in "incubation" and examination stages. =20 Please draft up your initial thoughts on these items and send me the latest= =20 version and I=01,ll add additional commentary.  I will be in all next week. Thanks, mike Cathy would you please review daily for updates and make the changes on a running list.  I'll read for info only and you can update them.  After I read them and waiting 1 day, I'll delete from the system. thanks, mike Thanks. m 	Enron North America Corp. 	 Monica, This looks ok, but I can give you more accurate and more up to date slides for the future.  One important fact, we do not distibute the EOL slides to the general public.  Normally what we do is present the story but do not include hard copies with the conference hand outs. mike Greg, FYI.
