-------------------INTRODUCTION---------------------
====================================================

Anonymouth is a Java-based application that aims to
give users the tools and knowledge needed to begin
anonymizing documents they have written.

It does this by firing up JStylo libraries (an
author detection application also develped by PSAL)
to detect stylometric patterns and determine
features (like word length, bigrams, trigrams, etc.)
that the user should remove/add to help obsure their
style and identity.

Though Anonymouth and it's team works hard to
provide you with tools to help remove your identity
from documents you have written, WE CAN IN NO WAY
GUARANTEE THAT YOUR DOCUMENT IS ANONYMOUS OR NOT
ANONYMOUS. Anonymouth is always giving you it's best
guess, it's best idea of where your document stands,
though that should not any any time be taken as an
absolute (for example, you could have forgotten to
remove your name from the document and Anonymouth
has no way to know that that's your name and should
remove it). What we can say is Anonymouth is only as
good as you make it, and when used right can be
helpful in guiding your document towards the right
direction.

====================================================
-------------------INSTALLATION---------------------
====================================================

There quickest and easiest way to install Anonymouth
is to clone or download the zip of the Anonymouth
github project here:

https://github.com/psal/anonymouth

And then import this project as an existing project
into Eclipse (or clone and import directly within
Eclipse if you have the Eclipse eGit plugin).

This is currently the only ready way to compile and
run Anonymouth. We will be including a updated build
file soon so that you may build and run Anonymouth
easily within the command land, but sadly it hasn't
been done yet so this is the only option currently

====================================================
-------------------BUILD AND RUN--------------------
====================================================

Once Anonymouth is all set up in Eclipse, you need
only run ThePresident from the package
edu.drexel.psal.anonymouth.gooie to begin using it.

Please note that there are two main package
categories, JStylo and Anonymouth. The majority of
Anonymouth developement should be in the Anonymouth
packages as Anonymouth simply uses the JStylo
libraries for parts of the initial document process,
so beginners need only concern themselves with the
Anonymouth packages.

====================================================
-------------------DEPENDENCIES---------------------
====================================================

Java 7 is required to run Anonymouth. If you don't
yet have it, get it at Oracle's website here and
follow the installation instructions there:

http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp

If you are unsure whether or not you have it
installed, follow these steps to see:
OS X:
	-Open up Terminal (Applications/Utilities)
	-Type "java -version" without the quotes
	-If you see something like:

		java version "1.7.x_xx"

	 then you're ready to go! If not, then that
	 means you most likely don't have Java 7
	 installed, in which case you should go to the
	 download link above
WINDOWS:
	-Follow the instructions here:

	 http://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_
	 manual.xml

	 if you have version "1.7.x_xx", then you're
	 good to go! If not, then that means you most
	 likely don't have Java 7 installed, in which
	 case you should go to the download link above

If you are using Eclipse, also make sure that Java
7 is your selected compiler (Preferences/Java/
Compiler) and is an included Library in your java
Build Path (Not sure how to do this? Google is your
friend).

----------------------------------------------------

Anonymouth requires the included jsan_resources
directory in it's running directory (The main
Anonymouth directory containing lib, src, etc.). It
should be in the correct directy by default.

----------------------------------------------------

Anonymouth requires a corpus (basically a database
of other authors and documents they have written) to
run. It needs this so it can classify your documents
with respect to these other documents and their
styles so that Anonymouth can give you an idea of
how anonymous it thinks your document is and what
features to remove/add to help you get there. Three
different corpi are included in the project
directory for you to choose and are located at:

./anonymouth/jsan_resources/corpora/amt
./anonymouth/jsan_resources/corpora/drexel_1
./anonymouth/jsan_resources/enron_demo

Though we included corpi, you are more than welcome
to use any other corpus you may have. It is
recommended to use many different combinations of
authors so you can get the best posisble picture of
where your document stands anonymously with respect
to others.

----------------------------------------------------

Anonymouth also needs the following jars in the lib
directory (everything should already be included):

weka					3.7.9
fasttag					2.0
Jama					1.0.3
jaws					1.3
jcommon					1.0
freechart				1.0.14
jgaap					5.4.0
microsoft translator	0.6.1
miglayout				4.0
tt4j					1.0.15
