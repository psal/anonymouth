 Subject: Re: Solver Licence Key  Matt, How about dropping by around 2 pm and I'll show you how I could set this up.

Basically the parameters that need changing are those on the Optimizer sheet: Start/End Date Spreads Max Inj/With rates Max Storage volume Selected Curve Storage Facility I'm free all week, so let me know when and where if you want to get together.

I'd add an extra run option to the menu bar, and you could set up a list of parameters on a separate tab, each line corresponding to a complete run.  How about a meeting tomorrow when you could tell me what parameters need to be varied?

Anyway, I haven't tried it without the key, but if you say it works, then I'm sure it does.  One thing I'm realizing, though, is that it's taking me way too much time to babysit this thing through multiple runs of the model even when it does work.  In order to get the full benefit of your model I want to run it a zillion times for many different combinations of parameters.  So, if you haven't guessed already, I'm wondering how hard it would be to get this thing to zip through some preset combinations of parameters and save the results without me tending to it.  I envision a spreadsheet where I list out all of the parameter values for each run, and the model picks out the parameters, runs through a year's worth of data, and saves the summary sheet, then steps to the next set of variables.  In this way I could set it to run a bunch of times over night or something so it wouldn't tie up the work day.  Would this be just a separate macro?  What do you think?

The problems with our network licence for the solver have gone away - I do not really understand what happened.  Try the model aand see if it works OK - runs fine on my computer now, whereas it did not run 2 weeks ago.  I suspect some sort of network problem, and IT have not been able to figure out any more likely cause. Tom Matt, Hey, thanks for returning my call.  As you're probably out from work, I'll try you again when I get in tomorrow (thursday).  I basically just wanted to touch base again since Ken has now moved
