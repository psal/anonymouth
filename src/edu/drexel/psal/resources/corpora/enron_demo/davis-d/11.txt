ladies at my church.  She also forwarded this message to several other women outside of our church.  I want you to read it because I believe that it will encourage you to trust God if you are not and hold tight if you are because the effectual fervent prayers of the righteous do avail much.  Like I breifly stated earlier, I will have my prayer ministry group pray for you tonight and we will keep on praying for you until I hear you tell me ALL is well.  We try to meet every Monday night to pray over special prayer request that we have received along with praying for the needs our families, friends, church, government and even our enemies.  Our meeting start at 7pm but we really don't get started praying until 8pm so if you want to touch and agree with us around that time that would be great.  We're all in this together if you hurt we hurt. : ) I am writing to each of you because I need you to be in prayer with me this week. For the past two months, I have been going to the doctor, because of a lump I found under my arm.  As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and an ultrasound of my breast.  Both test came back abnormal and  I am seeing a specialist this week to determine if I need to have a biopsy or not. Since God has given me the task of doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy. I trust and believe that God will heal.  God gave me a revelation several months ago that ALL IS WELL since that time, my husband and I have reunited our family, we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you at this time, however, in the midst of those blessings, the devil has gotten mad.  So he has decided to try and pull me down once again.  I refuse to be brought down off this spiritual high that is truly a blessing from God. That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors I need you to be in prayer with me this week.  I see the specialist on Thursday and I will know then if I need to have the biopsy. God Bless Each of you and Season's Greetings Love Marylyn ________________________________________________________________ GET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!
