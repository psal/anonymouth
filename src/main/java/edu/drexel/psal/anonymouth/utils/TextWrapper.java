/**
 * Holds the TextWrapper at a given location within the document with respect to
 * the first index of the document (0).
 *
 * TextWrappers are the name I gave to any sort of character that are considered to
 * "wrap" or surround text in such a way that it makes all the text withing them part of
 * the existing sentence. The perfect example for this are quotations since, with the
 * TextWrapper code utilitized,<br>
 * 		<code>I said "Do tell! How cool." to my friend.</code><br>
 * will be highlighted and treated on the EDITOR side as a whole sentence (as it should
 * be), while on the TaggedSentence backend side the sentence is split as:<br>
 * 		I said "Do tell!<br>
 * 		 How cool.<br>
 * 		" to my friend.<br>
 * It would look awful to highlight it this way, which is why this exists.<br><br>
 *
 * Currently, the TextWrappers that are recognized and supported by SpecialCharTracker are:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>"" - Quotes</li>
 * 	<li>() - Parenthesis</li>
 * 	<li>[] - Brackets<li>
 * 	<li>{} - Squigglies<li>
 * </ul>
