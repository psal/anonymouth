			 * really care if we make a sentence break halfway through a quote
			 * or parenthesis. The only reason we were doing this is so it
			 * wouldn't look odd when highlighting these breaks for the user.
			 * The way around this is we just artificially extend the
			 * highlight past the currently focused sentence to where the
			 * actual end is.<br><br>
			 *
			 * This has a number of advantages. Firstly, it's significantly
			 * less prone to splitting up (or combining) sentences the user
			 * didn't want it to when deleting these text wrappers. This makes
			 * removing and adding them far more secure and natural since the
			 * minute your remove then all the sentences are ALREADY BROKEN UP
			 * THE WAY THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SINCE WE NEVER COMBINED THEM
			 * ALL IN THE FIRST PLACE.<br><br>
			 *
			 * Another significant advantage is it makes the highlighter make
			 * conceptual sense. When I first type a '"', that would indicate
			 * that all text after it is part of the new quote until we close
			 * it, meaning it will highlight all following text until the user
			 * closes it.
